## Running the Python Inference Script
The python script that we have for testing our model on a webcam is located in the HandDetection/models/research/object_detection directory.  Once you are in that directory the command ./runTest.py will launch the script.  Dependacies are python, openCV and tensorflow package for python.  To close the program hit the q key.  For best use only run the script for a few minutes at a time.
